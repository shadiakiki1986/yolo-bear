* a separate process should exist for getting nicknames/peerIDs' registered emails
** user should see a flag that a nickname/peerID is validated
** regardless of whether connected (getting data from peers) or not (getting data from dynamodb)
** this requires yolo-bear-server getEmail.php to support an extra parameter peerId that attaches to the row

* got to make my own heartbeat from admin2 to admin1
** because when admin1 disconnected from wifi on tablet, no disconnect event was fired for admin2 in browser
* disconnect button causes root scope in progress error in angular
* save tournament to server
* linking to tournament published results
