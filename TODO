** annoying when peer has bad connection... should show pending connection state instead of jumping to menu
** also annoying to have to copy paste id of peer using another tools such as irc or gmail... should have server automatically give all peer ids
* got to make my own heartbeat from admin2 to admin1
** because when admin1 disconnected from wifi on tablet, no disconnect event was fired for admin2 in browser
