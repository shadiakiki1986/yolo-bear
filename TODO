* why do I get "network" error and why does it fail to reconnect
* got to make my own heartbeat from admin2 to admin1
** because when admin1 disconnected from wifi on tablet, no disconnect event was fired for admin2 in browser
* disconnect button causes root scope in progress error in angular
* server saved tournaments and local tournaments: too many buttons, don't fit horizontally on small phone
