# Installation
* Published on Google Play store
* Available on the web <a href="http://genesis.akikieng.com/yolo-bear/">here</a>

# Following an existing tournament 
To connect to a tournament already being broadcasted
* click on "Follow" on the main menu
* Enter the ID of anyone already connected to the tournament
** If nobody is already connected, then enter the ID of the tournament organizer
** The tournament organizer can access his/her ID by going to "Connect" in the 2nd-level menu
* The dot on the top right indicates the state of the broadcast
** If it is green, then you're just waiting for the next results and are still connected
** If it is yellow, then you've just received a tournament update
** If it is red, then you're disconnected from the broadcaster
** If there is no dot, then you're not connected to any tournament yet

# Broadcasting a new tournament 
* To start entering teams, players, and stats about your tournament, click on "Broadcast" on the main menu
* Add new teams in the "Teams" section, new players in the "Players" section
* New games can be added by going to "Games" and then "Waiting"
* Games are organized by status: Waiting, Playing, Done
** The team "Win" field in the "Teams" section is the number of games in which the team has a higher score and the game has state "Done"
** The team "Lost" field and "Tied" fields follow the same logic
* The microphone on the top right shows the state of your broadcast
** A microphone indicates that you're the broadcaster, and no information is being sent to your audience
** A microphone with red lines indicates that you're sending your most recent update to your audience

# Advanced broadcasting management
* The person broadcasting the tournament is assigned "Admin 1" role
* The very next person to follow the tournament is assigned the "Admin 2" role
* In case "Admin 1" loses connection, "Admin 2" takes over the broadcasting of the tournament
** "Admin 2" will see the dot in the top right disappear and a microphone appear instead
* "Admin 1" has the power to change results and broadcast them to the audience
* "Admin 1" also can assign the "Admin 2" role to any person in the "Connect" section (on the 2nd-level menu)
** Use the "> A2" button next to the desired connection for this
* "Admin 1" can also give up the "Admin 1" role to another person in the same way the "Admin 2" role is assigned
